# home24 Test Aufgabe (Task 3)

**How do I run this code on your computer?**

First we need to download Python, this can be done from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To check if you have installed python, you can open a terminal and write "python" in it.

If it is installed, you will get the following response:
```
Python 3.8.10 (tags/v3.8.10:3d8993a, May  3 2021, 11:48:03) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You can close the terminal.

Now let's set up my completed task. To do this, you can copy the code below into the terminal or download the archive directly.

```
git clone https://github.com/StephanGF/home24_TestAufgabe.git
```

**After installing the files, you need to install the libraries used in my code, for this you need to open this folder in a terminal (you can do it with the command cd YOUR_PATH) and write the following command:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


# After successfully installing the libraries, you can finally run my code. To do this, you need to write in the terminal:

```
python main.py
```

or

```
python3 main.py
```

**That's all)**
